User Allocation
===============

User allocation algorithm for assigning users to specific tasks. This was created apart of an undergraduate research program at [NJIT](http://njit.edu). For more information about the project, check out http://web.njit.edu/~bieber/pubs.html>.

## Goals of Allocation Algorithm
* Fast and effecient
* Dynamic to the number of roles defined
* Able to meet certain constraints (user in role 1 is also user in role 4)
* Random
